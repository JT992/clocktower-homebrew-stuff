**Plague Doctor** + **Scarlet Woman**:
- If the Plague Doctor dies, a living Minion gains the Scarlet Woman ability in addition to their own ability, and learns this.

**Banshee** + **Vortox**:
- If the Vortox is in play and the Demon kills the Banshee, the players still learn that the Banshee has died.

**Slayer** + **Lleech**:
- If the Slayer slays the Lleech's host, the host dies.

**Sleeper** + **Lunatic**:
- A Minion learns who the Lunatic is if the Demon is a Sleeper. The Lunatic's choices do not get shared.
- The Lunatic cannot be a Sleeper (they cannot draw a good character token).
