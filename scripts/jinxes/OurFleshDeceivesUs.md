**Plague Doctor** + **Scarlet Woman**:

- If the Plague Doctor dies, a living Minion gains the Scarlet Woman ability in addition to their own ability, and learns this.

**Banshee** + **Vortox**:

- If the Vortox is in play and the Demon kills the Banshee, the players still learn that the Banshee has died.

**Slayer** + **Lleech**:

- If the Slayer slays the Lleech's host, the host dies.

**Sleeper** + **Lunatic**:

- A Minion learns who the Lunatic is if the Demon is a Sleeper. The Lunatic's choices do not get shared.
- The Lunatic cannot be a Sleeper (they cannot draw a good character token).

**Sleeper** + **Scarlet Woman**:

- If the Sleeper dies and the Scarlet Woman becomes the Demon, the Scarlet Woman
  registers as a Demon from now on but remains the Scarlet Woman. They wake each night to kill when the original Sleeper would wake.
