**Blabbermouth** + **Puzzlemaster**:

- If the Blabbermouth causes the Puzzlemaster's incorrect guess to give true info, the Puzzlemaster gets false info anyway.

**Sleeper** + **Lunatic**:

- A Minion learns who the Lunatic is if the Demon is a Sleeper. The Lunatic's choices do not get shared.
- The Lunatic cannot be a Sleeper (they cannot draw a good character token).
