**Scarlet Woman** + **Plague Doctor**:

- If the Plague Doctor dies, a living Minion gains the Scarlet Woman ability in addition to their own ability, and learns this.

**Sleeper** + **Lunatic**:

- A Minion learns who the Lunatic is if the Demon is a Sleeper. The Lunatic's choices do not get shared.
- The Lunatic cannot be a Sleeper (they cannot draw a good character token).
