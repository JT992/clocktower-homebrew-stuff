Chances are if you're reading this because you're interested in BOTC you already know what these are.
If you don't, then the Wiki will summarise better than I can:

## Misfortune Stewing

My simplest custom script. I made this as a step up from Trouble Brewing when I thought my group was ready for more,
but before we had enough to play with BMR or S&V.

**Complexity**: A little bit. No more than Sects & Violets.

**Key Characters**: Snake Charmer, Lunatic, Cerenovus, Vortox

## Us Vs. Them

I don't really know what to say about this script. We haven't played it much, but I'm fairly sure we liked it.

**Complexity**: slightly more

**Key Characters**: Politician, Lil' Monsta, Leviathan

## Be Fruitful and Multiply

This script was designed for a small group to get around the restrictions of Teensyville rules without introducing a Toymaker
(because we didn't know that existed yet. now we use that instead. still a good script though).

**Complexity**: more

**Key Characters**: Summoner, Vizier, Marionette

## The Inquisition

The first of my homebrew scripts, The Inquisition gives the good time some very powerful info gatherers, but the evil team
has several ways for extra players to die in the night, or to even win outright early on. That is, if they even exist...

**Complexity**: quite

**Key Characters**: Detective, Atheist, Blabbermouth

## Our Flesh Deceives Us

In Our Flesh Deceives Us, confirmation of your own character is critical. Townsfolk can be Drunks.
Demons can be Lunatics. And anyone who chooses people in the night might accidentally leave corpses in their wake...

**Complexity**: very

**Key Characters**: Banshee, Pit-Hag, Sleeper

## Cleave Soul to Body

It's well known that death is not the end in Ravenswood Bluff, and that's especially true in this script.
A Necromancer who stays alive for enough days can jump Fang Gu-style to any dead good player, but might turn that player evil in the process.

**Complexity**: yes

**Key Characters**: Necromancer, Mezepheles, Legion

## The Self is a Prison

This script features the Neurologist, the most experimental and powerful of my homebrew characters.
The Neurologist wires together the minds of two good players each night so that they wake together, giving them easy confirmation.
Beware the fatal mistake though: choose an evil player, and they learn who you are!

**Complexity**: really quite

**Key Characters**: Neurologist, Kazali, Lil' Monsta, Sleeper

## Discontent Looming

Discontent Looming is a much simpler demon hunt than most of my other scripts.
Like Misfortune Stewing, it features exclusively release characters - with one major exception.

**Complexity**: a little more than Misfortune Stewing, but not much

**Key Characters**: Klutz, Cerenovus, Riot

## Death Is Just The Beginning

This script is to Bad Moon Rising what Misfortune Stewing is to Trouble Brewing.
The death extravaganza of BMR is magnified here with a small selection of experimental characters.

**Complexity**: more

**Key Characters**: Banshee, Psychopath, Boomdandy

## Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

Many characters on this script can go to sleep on one team and wake up on another. Every. Single. Night.

**Complexity**: yes

**Key Characters**: Bounty Hunter, Cult Leader, Summoner, Mezepheles

**Fabled**: Enameled Ghost (if the evil players equal or outnumber the good players, executions fail if only evil votes)

## Terminated Sentences

_WIP_

A fully homebrew script with characters based on criminals and prison workers.

**Complexity**: unknown

**Key Characters**: all of them

# Misc. Scripts

## Trouble Choosing

Trouble Brewing with an Al-Hadikhia. That's it.

**Complexity**: it's just Trouble Brewing

**Key Characters**: same as Trouble Brewing. (and an Al-Hadikhia.)

[I found this from this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO9FNEwIcU)

## If All Live

Another Al-Hadikhia script, this one a little trickier to follow for the good team. And by a little, I mean a lot.
Unless of course the Demon kills the King on the first night, but that would never happen.

**Complexity**: quite

**Key Characters**: King, Mezepheles, Marionette, Al-Hadikhia

I don't know who made this script, but I found it from [this NRB video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyTQRPH8qhs).
(fun fact: that video was the second game of Clocktower I ever watched. I had a hell of an introduction to this game.)
